PolyPool is a polymorphic object pool written in C++11.

Under the hood it relies on RTTI and stores objects using boost
candidate library boost::poly_collection.

It is a header only library, so nothing to compile. Just #include
"PolyPool.h" and you are good to go.

This project is still in its early stages. Expect frequent interface
changes and bugs.
